description: Get up and running with Dapr Jobs and the Dapr .NET SDK
---

With the Dapr Job package, you can interact with the Dapr Cryptography APIs from a .NET application to trigger future operations
to run according to a predefined schedule with an optional payload.

To get started, walk through the [Dapr Cryptography]({{< ref dotnet-cryptography-howto.md >}}) how-to guide and refer to
[best practices documentation]({{< ref dotnet-cryptographyclient-usage.md >}}) for additional guidance.
